            \  Please evaluate the user's answer in relation to the
            expected answer: Responses may include challenges with API
            integration, file uploads, or UI design..

            \  # Assessment Criteria

            \  - Determine if the user's response demonstrates a
            clear understanding of the key concepts and ideas presented in the
            expected answer.

            \  - Consider synonyms, paraphrasing, and different
            phrasing that convey the same meaning.

            \  - Be flexible and focus on the essence of the answer
            rather than exact wording.


            \  # Response Guidelines:

            understanding, return 'correct: true'.

            \    - Provide a positive and affirming message,
            congratulating them and reinforcing their understanding.

            \  - If the user's answer is incorrect or incomplete,
            return 'correct: false'.

            \    - Gently explain why the answer is not fully
            correct or what may be missing.

            \    - Encourage them to try again, being empathetic and
            supportive.
